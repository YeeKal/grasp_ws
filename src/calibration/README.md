# Robotic Hand-eye Calibration Workspace 
| **`Ubuntu 1604 & ROS Kinetic Kame`** |  

This repo contains my self-collected, self-developed hand-eye calibration tools (Cplusplus & ROS) in **JD京东 GRASPING ROBOT CHALLENGE ([News](http://me.sjtu.edu.cn/news/12692.html))**, and the implements of my paper: **Robotic hand-eye calibration with depth camera: A sphere model approach** (**[PDF](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8384652/)**)

Inside `/src` there are four ROS packages:    

**1. camera_transform_publisher**  
publish the transformation matrix (relative pose) between camera and marker  
**2. handeye_calib_chessboard**  
common handeye calib tools that use RGB camera and chessboard, forked from [link](https://github.com/jhu-lcsr/handeye_calib_camodocal.git)   
**3. handeye_calib_sphere**  
self-developed fine-tune method tackling handeye calb with RGB-D camera  
**4. rgbd_srv** 
common ROS srv folder


## Prerequisit
* **Ubuntu 16.04** 
* **ROS Kinetic Kame**  // full install   
* **PCL 1.7+** (should be included in ROS Kinetic Kame)
* **OpenCV 3.3** (should be included in ROS Kinetic Kame)
* **cv_bridge**  
`sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-cv-bridge`
* **visp_hand2eye_calibration_calibrator**  
`sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-visp-hand2eye-calibration`
* **Eigen3**  (should be included in Ubutnu 16.04)  
`sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev`
* **Sophus** (https://github.com/stonier/sophus)  // standard make and make install
* **Ceres** (http://ceres-solver.org/) // follow the installation guild
